      `The Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine is a highly effective immunisation that protects against three serious viral infections. Measles is one of the most contagious and dangerous diseases, while mumps and rubella can lead to severe complications such as brain inflammation, hearing loss, and birth defects.\n\n` +
      `Two doses of the MMR vaccine provide over 99% protection against measles, playing a crucial role in preventing outbreaks and protecting vulnerable groups like infants, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals.\n\n` +
      `The MMR vaccine is free for children under 18 and adults eligible for New Zealand's public healthcare system. It is particularly important for individuals born between 1989 and 2004, as many in this group may not have received full immunisation. Adults need two doses at least four weeks apart for maximum protection.\n\n` +
      `If you're unsure about your vaccination status, it is recommended to get vaccinated—there is no risk in receiving extra doses. Those born before 1969 may already have natural immunity due to prior exposure but should consult a healthcare provider if travelling. Immunocompromised individuals cannot receive the vaccine, so it’s essential for their close contacts to be fully vaccinated. Widespread immunisation helps protect the entire community and prevents severe health risks.`

      `The COVID-19 vaccine is a safe and effective way to protect against severe illness, hospitalisation, and complications caused by COVID-19. For free in Aotearoa, New Zealand, the vaccine is offered to everyone aged 5 and older and to children aged 6 months to 4 years at higher risk of severe illness due to underlying health conditions.\n\n` +
      `Vaccination is recommended even for those who have recovered from COVID-19, as it provides longer-lasting protection. Waiting at least six months after a COVID-19 infection or your last dose before receiving an additional vaccine is advised to maximise immunity benefits.\n\n` +
      `Eligibility for additional doses depends on factors like age, health conditions, pregnancy, or being immunocompromised. For example, children with chronic health conditions and adults over 30 are encouraged to stay updated with their immunisations. Healthcare providers can guide you on the appropriate timing and dose based on your circumstances.\n\n` +
      `The vaccine used in New Zealand is the Pfizer JN.1 monovalent vaccine, designed to target recent virus strains. Medsafe ensures its safety, efficacy, and quality through rigorous standards.`
